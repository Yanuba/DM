# Outlier detection on Sensor Data

The aim of this work is to perform an outlier detection on a stream of sensor data.

The data on which the analisys is performed comes from three different wireless technologies.

1. The sensors transmit over the wi-fi network
2. The sensors transmit using XBee 802.15.4 at 2.4 GHz. 
3. The sensors transmit using a LoRa (Long Range) at 864MHz
